#Blockquotes by using "greater than" caret (>). Remember if spaces are in between a quited paragraph, they must contain >
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

##Make the entire quotation a block quote by inserting a caret on each line.
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where >Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

##Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images, or links.
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: *VIVE L'IRLANDE*!

We pictured the meek mild creatures where..They dwelt in their strawy pen,..Nor did it occur to one of us there..
To doubt they were kneeling then.

#Conclusions
You’ve completed all the lessons!

>Believe it or not, we’ve only *just begun* exploring what can be accomplished with Markdown. There are many “extended” implementations of Markdown that support formats like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more. Because they’re non-standard, they’re not essential to learning the basics, as we’ve introduced here.

If you’d like to know more about these Markdown implementations, you’re welcome to explore any number of other Markdown apps and tutorials. Here are just a few:
